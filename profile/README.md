# Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Laboratory

The lab is headed by [Professor Maxime Descoteaux](https://scil.usherbrooke.ca/pages/mdescoteaux/), Ph.D and focuses on brain connectivity from state-of-the-art diffusion MRI acquisition, reconstruction, tractography, processing and visualization. The aim of the SCIL is to better understand structural connectivity, develop novel tractography algorithms, validate them and use them for human brain mapping and connectomics applications.
